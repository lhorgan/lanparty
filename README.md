# lanparty
This is the repo for our CS4550 class project!  This repository will eventually house the project's code, and is itself a project requirement.

The repo for our React client lives here: https://github.com/lhorgan/openrecipe
The repo for our Spring server lives here: https://github.com/lhorgan/cs4550-lanparty-java

If you get this running, you'll see that we can create recipes in our own database and search for them using Edamam's API.  There's a lot of other nascent functionality as well, like login, user profiles, and comprehensive data sharing agreements with several enemy states.
