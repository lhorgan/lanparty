This is the wrapper repo for our CS4550 class project!

1) The repo for our React client lives here: https://github.com/lhorgan/openrecipe
2) The repo for our Spring server lives here: https://github.com/lhorgan/cs4550-lanparty-java

If you get this running, you'll see that we can create recipes in our own database and search for them using Edamam's API.  There's a lot of other nascent functionality as well, like login, user profiles, and comprehensive data sharing agreements with several enemy states.

If you don't get it running, actually, you can STILL see these things by visiting it on Heroku!  https://recipe-client-4550.herokuapp.com/
